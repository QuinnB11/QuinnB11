ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on full-stack development with the MERN stack, iOS development with Swift, and mobile apps with Flutter. Iâ€™m also conducting research on program PTA (Points-to Analysis) in Rust to develop a tool called Rupta Flow Sensitiveâ€”exciting stuff!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning and honing my skills in React, Swift, TypeScript, and whatever other exciting tech catches my attention.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on interesting projectsâ€”letâ€™s build something awesome together!
